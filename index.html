                  <p><strong>By <span class="red">Sarah Johnson</span> | Wednesday, December 1, 2021  </strong></p>

                  <p>A new treatment, coined "COPD Gummies" have been making waves on social media as a new hope for struggling COPD patients. <strong> The initial product made headlines after two sisters raised $2.5 million dollars during an episode of Shark Tank</strong> . Since then, thousands of recovery stories have been shared on social media claiming that this new treatment has relieved symptoms in just days.</p>

                  <p><strong>Editors Note: For readers looking to purchase the COPD Gummies reviewed in this article,<span class="red">click here to purchase.</span>

                </strong></p>

                <p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or "COPD," has been previously known as a disease that is nearly untreatable. <strong>With such optimistic claims going viral on social media, our team decided to dig into this "miracle" to determine if this treatment is a hoax, or indeed a valid option for patients struggling with COPD.</strong></p>

                <h2>Meet Darren Murphy, a COPD patient who used <span class="red">Botanical Farms CBD Gummies</span></h2>
                <p>For 33 years, Darren Murphy smoked nearly a pack per day. In the back of his mind he knew it would catch up to him eventually, but never seemed to kick the habit. It wasn't until tragedy struck that he decided to quit smoking for good. <strong>Three years ago Darren's wife died of lung cancer, leaving him with 2 kids and 6 grandchildren. After mourning the loss of his wife, Darren decided to quit for good.</strong>
                </p>


                <p><strong>"After losing Lisa to lung cancer, I knew it was just a matter of time until this bad habit caught up to me and would leave my grandkids without grandparents to watch them grow up. I just couldn't live with that thought," said Murphy</strong>
                </p>


<p>In 2018 Darren quit smoking cold turkey after his wife's passing. After he finally quit, he thought all of his worries were over...the years following, the condition of his lungs continued to deteriorate. In 2020, his doctor diagnosed him with Stage 3 COPD.

</p>

<div>
    <img src="./index_files/Doc and hospital bed.png" alt="">
</div>
<p><strong>"I thought that quitting was all I had to do to protect my future...I was terribly wrong. After quitting, my COPD symptoms got worse and worse. The shortness of breath, constant coughing, and lungs filled with phlegm made daily living miserable."</strong></p>
<p>As if Stage 3 COPD, and losing his wife to lung cancer wasn't enough... <strong>Darren contracted COVID-19 in the middle of the pandemic.</strong> He was put on a ventilator and spent two weeks in the hospital fighting for his life. Due to the state of his lungs, doctors weren't optimistic about his recovery.</p>

<div>
    <img src="./index_files/vent with nurses.png" alt="">
</div>


<p>Miraculously, Darren was able to fight off COVID-19 and make a full recovery. His lungs however, were still struggling with Stage-3 COPD. <strong> His doctors recommended a few treatments but none of them were able to clear any of his symptoms; he was utterly hopeless</strong></p>
<p><strong>"I started seeing articles about how these sisters created a CBD Gummy for COPD patients and raised a bunch of money on Shark Tank. I was skeptical at first so I asked my doctor about them. He said that the main ingredient was CBD, and although they've only been available since 2018, there is a lot of research that suggests they might be able to treat COPD symptoms."</strong></p>

<p>As a last resort and with a sliver of hope, Darren purchased Botanical Farms CBD Gummies to see if they'd be able to help manage his COPD symptoms.</p>


<p><strong>"I started by taking two gummies at 9am. After the second day I realized that I was feeling less breathless. I didn't notice at first because I simply wasn't breathless any more. After a few days my lungs were feeling so much better that I was able to play golf with my friends for the first time in a couple years. My heart and gratitude goes to the sisters who created this product."</strong></p>

<p>At first, Darren was skeptical as many COPD patients were when they first discovered this treatment. However, after taking a chance to see if they could get their life back, they quickly found hope in this new treatment.</p>

<h2 class="h-2">So how do these gummies actually work? We asked Darren's doctor</h2>

<p><strong>While there are a number of "supplements" on the market that are claiming to help with COPD and medicines claiming to ease COPD, the Khalile sisters have created the first reuptake inhibitor (RI), making it immediately help COPD patients and improve their breathing.</strong></p>
<p>RI's work by blocking the inhibiting the plasmalemmal transporter-mediated reuptake of a neurotransmitter from the synapse into the pre-synaptic neuron. <strong>What this means to people without a doctorate in chemistry: a powerful way to Improve Breathing, Detox Lungs and Increase Oxygen Levels for COPD Patients.</strong></p>
<p>COPD industry is a massive market, but it's seldom reported on. Studies have shown that COPD causes 6 Million deaths around the world each year and it will be responsible for more than 8 Million deaths annually by 2030.</p>
<h2 class="h-2">Will <span class="red"> Botanical Farms CBD Gummies</span> work for you?</h2>
<p>There are a lot of unproven COPD solutions you can try. Some of them include taking medicines with dangerous side effects. Others involve putting needles into your body. With so many options it's only normal to be skeptical about results. So instead of promising our readers anything we challenge you to follow in Kathy’s footsteps and try it yourself.
